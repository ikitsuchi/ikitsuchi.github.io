I have finally discovered my dream keyboard.

## Old Flame

Previously, I was using a generic-brand mechanical keyboard equipped with TTC Gold Pink linear switches, featuring approximately 37g pressing pressure, which give it a light and smooth tactile feel.

For me, the greatest advantage of mechanical keyboards lies in its n key rollover, which means all keys on the keyboard can be pressed and detected simultaneously, while typically membrane keyboards only support six-key rollover or fewer. As a rhythm game enthusiast, situations where I need to press up to 8 keys simultaneously can occur, however, membrane keyboards may struggle to handle such scenarios.

This is one of the rare advantages of mechanical keyboards for me. There are indeed many drawbacks to mechanical keyboards.

First, mechanical keyboards can be quite noisy. The keyboard community in China is currently obsessively pursuing a better click sound for switches, and I find this to be a completely misguided priority. Not to mention, I believe the most crucial aspect of a keyboard should be its tactile feel. The so-called excellent sound pursued by keyboard DIY players might be nothing more than noise to others' ears. People spend a lot of time using padding between the PCB and the case, lubricating the springs of switches, but is there a significant payoff? I don't think so. I don't feel like spending my money on these stuffs!

Additionally, using a mechanical keyboard for an extended period can be tiring. This fatigue is not solely due to the actuation force but, in my opinion, is more related to their longer key travel distance. While switches don't require bottoming out to be activated, I'm more accustomed to bottoming out. This results in my fingers having to travel a much longer distance while typing. Choosing switches with a lower actuation force can make some improvement, but it can't completely solve this problem. The currently popular low-profile mechanical keyboards, such as the Nuphy Air75, are reported to be less fatiguing according to reviews. However, they tend to be quite expensive. ðŸ˜¢

In general, I don't plan to continue using mechanical keyboards, at least not when writing code or documents.

## New Love

While many may not share this view, personally, I find the tactile feel of laptop keyboards to be quite decent. My favorite type of keyboard is the scissor-switch keyboard, and the built-in keyboard on laptops is exactly that. The tactile feel of scissor-switch keyboards falls between membrane keyboards and mechanical keyboards. Its key travel is much shorter compared to mechanical keyboards, yet the scissor-like switch provides a exponentially better tactile feedback compared to membrane keyboards. In fact, from my personal experience, I don't think scissor switches have a worse tactile feel compared to the mechanical switches.

So, I've made up my mind. I'm going to buy a scissor-switch keyboard!

### Requirements Analysis

As someone who struggles with decision-making, I will definitely analyze my requirements and choose a product that best suits my needs as much as possible.

- I'm not inclined to buy another generic-brand product. I'm looking for a relatively well-known brand that offers quality and warranty assurance. So I have narrowed down my options to Cherry Stream, Logitech MX Keys, and Apple Magic Keyboard.
- I don't like having a clutter of wires on my desk, and since I won't be using this keyboard for gaming, I don't need to worry about latency issues. Since my computer has limited USB ports, I prefer a Bluetooth connection over a 2.4G connection. So, I'm opting for a wireless keyboard. So, the Cherry Stream is eliminated from consideration.
- I want the keyboard to be compatible with my MacBook, Windows laptop, and iPad. However, using an Apple Magic keyboard for a Windows computer feels a bit awkward to me, and the compatibility might not be ideal.

In the end, I chose Logitech MX Keys Mini. It perfectly meets my requirements and even has some additional advantages. I don't need a numeric keypad at all, so I'll go for the mini version. It's more compact, making it easier to carry and place. The device-switching feature is also perfect for me. Using the switch key on the keyboard, I can work across different devices and operating systems smoothly.

### Experience

I was initially considering buying a second-hand one to save some money. But coincidentally, the Logitech official store on JD.com is currently having a discount promotion. The MX Keys Mini for Business is priced at 499 RMB, with a two-year warranty and a free wrist rest. So, in the end, I purchased it from the official store. With the warranty, I can use it without worries, and the second-hand item may not come with a guarantee. Also, it's only slightly around 100 RMB cheaper than the official store. Considering all these factors, I don't think 499 RMB is particularly expensive.

The delivery speed of the official JD.com store is, as always, impressively fast. I placed the order at 1 AM, and the delivery was at my doorstep by 6 PM on the same day.

Like most nerds, I have a preference for black, but it was out of stock when I made the purchase, so I ended up buying the gray one. After seeing the actual product, I think the gray version is not ugly at all, it's quite attractive. Turning on the backlight in dim lighting looks pretty cool.

![BACKLIGHTING ON!](images/mx-keys-mini-backlighting.jpg)

However, to save power, I turned off the backlighting. ðŸ¤£ With the backlighting on, it would stay powered up for about 10 days on a full charge, but with the backlighting off, it can last for 5 months.

I have been rambling on a bit, so let me quickly share some of my impressions based on my actual experience.
- The keyboard's workmanship is good, and it looks very exquisite. However, its keycaps are made of ABS material, and I have a feeling they might develop a greasy shine very soon, but I'm not too concerned about that.
- It looks compact, but surprisingly, it has some weight to it. I feel it's comparable in weight to the 11-inch iPad Pro.
- The wireless connection is very stable, with no interruptions or key lag. In scenarios where low latency is not critical, I feel it's not much different from a wired connection.

Let's talk about the tactile feel, which is crucial when it comes to keyboards. I've been using this keyboard for a week now, and I can only describe my feelings as addicted. Typing on this keyboard is an absolute pleasure.
- Logitech claims that the keys are "spherically-dished, shaped for fingertips". The actual experience is that these keys with circular grooves provide a sense of wrapping around the fingertips. It's a difficult feeling to describe, but overall, it is indeed very comfortable, I think it does reduce the chances of a mistype.
- Its tactile feel is somewhat firm, and the rebound force is quite strong â€“ a type that I personally enjoy. I have used a Logitech K380 as well, and its rebound was just very weak, and I dislike it so much that I sold it quickly.
- The key travel of the MX Keys Mini is also very short.
- Taking all these factors into account, the most intuitive feeling it gives me is that now I can type faster, more fluent, and more precise. A good keyboard can really enhance productivity. For example, I have noticed a considerable increase in my coding time this week. ðŸ˜‚

Of course, it also has its drawbacks.
- I really dislike small arrow keys, but for a compact layout keyboard, I can only accept it.
- It is completely wireless, which means that even if I connect it to the computer using a USB-C cable, it won't work directly, it has to be connected via Bluetooth. Sometimes I connect the keyboard to the computer for charging, but it's not connected to the computer through this cable. It's kind of weird.
- The included manual is too brief and almost useless. For instance, I couldn't find information about the keyboard's key combinations. I had to turn to Reddit to discover that <kbd>Page Up</kbd> is achieved by <kbd><kbd>fn</kbd> + <kbd>up arrow</kbd></kbd>.
- I feel the most frustrating aspect during usage is an operational logic. We can press <kbd><kbd>fn</kbd> + <kbd>esc</kbd></kbd> to switch between F-Keys mode and Media Keys mode. In F-Keys mode, muting and decreasing the volume both require holding <kbd>fn</kbd>, but increasing the volume does not. The reason is that <kbd>Insert</kbd> doesn't belong to the F-Keys, this button is not controlled by F-Keys mode or Media Keys mode. This inconsistency in the operations of the three keys that control volume in F-Keys mode is, in my opinion, quite absurd! ðŸ˜…
- The mouse I'm currently using is the Logitech G304, which doesn't support the Bolt receiver. If I want to connect the keyboard via the Bolt receiver, I would need to have both the Bolt receiver and the G304 receiver plugged in, occupying two of my USB ports. Well, that doesn't seem to be a keyboard issue. I might consider switching to a mouse supporting Bluetooth or the Bolt receiver in the future.

I have used the Magic Keyboard before, and I find that the tactile feedback of the MX Keys Mini is better. Its rebound feels more agile. However, the MX Keys Mini is much heavier than the Magic Keyboard, making it less convenient to carry around. Both of them have its own strengths and weaknesses.

Overall, I am very satisfied with the MX Keys Mini. It's a keyboard that makes me want to keep using it. Will I consider changing the keyboard later on? I don't know. For now, I'm just enjoying the present.
